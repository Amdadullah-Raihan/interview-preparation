### 1. What is Doctype in HTML?

The declaration is not an `HTML` tag. It is "information" to the browser about what **document type** to expect. It tells the browser which version of the `HTML` we are using.
`<!DOCTYPE html>` means we are using `HTML 5`.

`HTML 5` is the newest version of `HTML`. It brings some new features like semantic tags. It also increases the ==SEO== capability.
